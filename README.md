Implement a **g**olang compiler and minimal runtime environment within **5** functions. Inspired by [c4](https://github.com/rswier/c4) project. To compile it, we need a modern compiler, that is, it should support cpp17 language standard.(Recommend to use msvc2017 or gcc7.0).

*ps: code commit might be frequent, you can star it rather than watching.*
